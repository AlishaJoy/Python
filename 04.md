### Lists in Python

Lists in Python are a collection of items. They can be of any type and are written with square brackets `[]` with commas separating the items.

*Creating a list:*

To create a list, we can simply write comma-separated values inside the square brackets:
```py
names = ['joy','reni','reshma','bindhu']
```
*Accessing list items*

To access the list items, we can use indexing. The index starts from 0:
```py
print(names[2]) # outputs: reshma
```
We can also access a range of items in the list using the slicing operator `:`.
```py
print(names[:3]) # outputs: ['joy', 'reni', 'reshma']
print(names[2:]) # outputs: ['reshma', 'bindhu']
```
