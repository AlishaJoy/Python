### Lists in Python

Lists in Python are a collection of items. They can be of any type and are written with square brackets `[]` with commas separating the items.

*Creating a list:*

To create a list, we can simply write comma-separated values inside the square brackets:
```py
names = ['joy','reni','reshma','bindhu']
```
*Accessing list items*

To access the list items, we can use indexing. The index starts from 0:
```py
print(names[2]) # outputs: reshma
```
We can also access a range of items in the list using the slicing operator `:`.
```py
print(names[:3]) # outputs: ['joy', 'reni', 'reshma']
print(names[2:]) # outputs: ['reshma', 'bindhu']
```
Modifying list
We can add items to the list using` append()` method.
```py
names.append("jeena")
```
We can insert items at a specific position using `insert()` method:
```py
names.insert(0,"ben")
```
We can also concatenate two lists using the + operator or using the `extend()` method:
```py
names.extend(fruits)
```
We can remove an item from the list using the `remove()` method:
```py
names.remove("reni")
```
We can remove the last item from the list using the `pop()` method. We can also remove an item at a specific position using the `pop()` method:
```py
names.pop()
names.pop()
names.pop()
```
We can reverse the order of items in the list using the `reverse()` method.
We can sort the items in the list using the `sort()` method. We can also sort in reverse order using the `sort(reverse = True)` method.
If we don't want to alter the original list and make a copy of sorted list, we can use the `sorted()` function instead of the `sort()` method.
```py
names.reverse()
fruits.sort()
nums.sort()
nums.sort(reverse = True)
new_list = sorted(nums)
```

We can find the minimum and maximum values of the list using the `min()` and `max()` methods.
We can also find the sum of all the values in the list using the `sum()` method.
We can find the index of an item in the list using the `index()` method.
```py
print(min(nums))
print(max(nums))
print(sum(nums))
print(names.index('joy'))
```
We can check if an item is present in the list using the `in` operator:
```py
print('old' in names)
print('bindhu' in names)
```
We can iterate through all the items in the list using a `for` loop.We can also iterate through all the items in the list along with their index using the `enumerate()` function.
```py
for all_names in names:
    print(all_names)

for index,all_names in enumerate(names):
    print(index,all_names)
```
We can join the list items into a single string using the `join()` method. We can split a string into a list using the `split()` method:
```py
new = '---'.join(fruits)
back = new.split('---')
```

### Tuples in python

In Python, lists and tuples are both used to store collections of items. However, they have some key differences:

**Lists**
- Lists are **mutable**, meaning their elements can be modified after creation.
- Elements in a list are enclosed in square brackets `[]`.
- Lists can be created using square brackets `[]` or the `list()` function.
- Elements in a list can be added, removed, or modified using various methods.
- Example:
  ```py
  colors = ['red', 'black', 'blue']
  colors[2] = 'green'
  print(colors)  # Output: ['red', 'black', 'green']
  ```

**Tuples**
- Tuples are **immutable**, meaning their elements cannot be modified after creation.
- Elements in a tuple are enclosed in parentheses `()`.
- Tuples can be created using parentheses `()` or the `tuple()` function.
- Elements in a tuple cannot be added, removed, or modified once the tuple is created.
- Example:
  ```py
  colors = ('red', 'black', 'blue')
  # The following line will raise an error since tuples are immutable
  colors[2] = 'green'
  ```

### Sets in python

Sets in Python are used to store collections of unique elements. Here are some characteristics of sets:

- Sets are **unordered**, meaning the elements are not stored in any specific order.
- Sets are defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.
- Duplicate elements are automatically removed in a set, ensuring uniqueness.
- Sets support mathematical set operations such as intersection, difference, and union.
- Example:
  ```python
  veg = {'potato', 'tomato', 'carrots'}
  veggie = {'beans', 'gaurd', 'tomato'}
  
  print(veg.intersection(veggie))  # Output: {'tomato'}
  print(veg.difference(veggie))    # Output: {'carrots', 'potato'}
  print(veg.union(veggie))         # Output: {'tomato', 'carrots', 'potato', 'gaurd', 'beans'}
  ```

*Empty Collections*

You can create empty lists, tuples, and sets using the following methods:

- Empty List:
  ```python
  empty_list = []
  empty_list = list()
  ```

- Empty Tuple:
  ```python
  empty_tuple = ()
  empty_tuple = tuple()
  ```

- Empty Set:
  ```python
  empty_set = set()
  ```

Note that creating an empty set using `{}` will create an empty dictionary instead, so it's recommended to use the `set()` function for an empty set.

These are the main characteristics and usage examples of lists, tuples, and sets in Python.
