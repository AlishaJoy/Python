### Basic print statements

`` print('hello all') ``

The `print()` function in Python is used to display text or output on the screen. In the example above, the message 'hello all' is passed as an argument to the `print()` function, and it is displayed on the screen when the program is run.


Define two string variables

``a = 'Learn Python Basics``
``b = " welcome to the class"``

Concatenate the two strings and assign the result to a new variable

``c = a + ',' + b``

Concatenate the new variable with additional strings and spaces, and assign the result back to itself

``c = ' ' + c + ' are you excited!' ``

Create a new string using string formatting and assign it to a new variable

``d = '{} by step by step processs'.format(a) ``

Print various properties of the string variables:

``print(a)      ``                    # Learn Python Basics

``print(a[9])    ``                   # B

``print(a[6:])     ``                 # Python Basics

In Python, you can extract a portion of a string using the slicing operator `[]`. The operator takes two arguments: the starting index and the ending index of the portion you want to extract. In the example above, `a[6:]` extracts a portion of the string `a` starting from the 7th character (index 6) to the end of the string. This portion is then assigned to a new variable `b`, which is printed to the screen. The result is `Python Basics`, which is the portion of the original string `a `starting from the 7th character.

``print(len(b))      ``               # 17

``print(b[0:8])        ``             #  welcome

``print(a.lower())  ``                # learn python basics

``print(b.upper())    ``              #  WELCOME TO THE CLASS

``print(a.count('n'))   ``            # 2

``print(b.find('o'))      ``          # 4

The `find()` method in Python is used to search for a substring within a string. It takes one argument, which is the substring you want to search for. The method returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string, or `-1 `if the substring is not found.

In the example above, the `find()` method is used to search for the first occurrence of the letter 'o' in the string `a`. The method returns the index of the first occurrence, which is 4. This value is then printed to the screen using the `print() `function.

``print(a.replace('Python', 'Python language'))``   # Learn Python language Basics

``print(c) ``                         #  Learn Python Basics, welcome to the class are you excited!

``print(d)    ``                      # Learn Python Basics by step by step processs

### Integers and floats 

Integers and Floats

`w = 10`

`print(type(w)) `  # Output: <class 'int'>

*Arithmetic operations*

`print(10 + 2) `    # Output: 12

`print(3 - 20)  `   # Output: -17

`print(4 * 2)     ` # Output: 8

`print(33 / 4)   `  # Output: 8.25

`print(44 % 2)  `   # Output: 0

`print(3 // 5) `    # Output: 0

`print(3 ** 2)`     # Output: 9

`print(99 * 9 + 1)` # Output: 892

*Using variables* 

`w += 22`

`print(w) `         # Output: 32

`print(abs(-22))   `# Output: 22
`print(round(55.88)) `   # Output: 56
`print(round(99.333,2)) `# Output: 99.33

*Comparisons*

`a = 20`

`b = 60`

`print(a == b)   `  # Output: False

`print(a != b)    ` # Output: True

`print(a > b)      `# Output: False

`print(a < b)    `  # Output: True

`print(a >= b)    ` # Output: False

`print(a <= b)     `# Output: True

*Strings*

`a = '292' `

`b = '44' `

`print(a + b)  `    # Output: '29244'

### variables and datatype

In Python, a variable is a container that stores data values. Every value in Python has a data type that specifies the kind of value it is, and the interpreter uses this information to perform various operations on the value.

Python has several built-in data types, including:

- **Numeric** - represents numeric values and includes integers, floats, and complex numbers.

- **String** - represents text and is enclosed in single or double quotes.

- **Boolean**- represents a Boolean value (either True or False).

- **Sequence Types** - represents sequences of values, including lists, tuples, and range objects.

- **Dictionary** - represents key-value pairs.

- **Sets** - represents sets of unique values.

- **NoneType** - represents the absence of a value.

When you assign a value to a variable in Python, the interpreter automatically determines the data type based on the value assigned. For example, if you assign the value 5 to a variable x, Python will assign the data type int (integer) to the variable x.


**Printing the data type**

`print(type(x))` # <class 'int'>

`print(type(y))` # <class 'str'>

`print(type(z))` # <class 'bool'>

In summary, variables in Python are containers that can hold different types of data, and Python automatically determines the data type based on the value assigned. The different types of data in Python include numeric, string, boolean, sequence types, dictionary, sets, and NoneType.

### Typeconversion 

In Python, type conversion or typecasting is the process of converting one data type to another data type. There are different built-in functions in Python that allow us to convert data from one type to another.

Here are some common type conversion functions in Python:

`int()` : This function converts a value to an integer. If the value is a float, it will be rounded down to the nearest integer.

`float()` : This function converts a value to a floating-point number.

`str()` : This function converts a value to a string.

`bool() `: This function converts a value to a boolean. The value will be converted to True if it is not zero or an empty string, otherwise it will be converted to False.

`list()` : This function converts a sequence (tuple, string, etc.) to a list.

` tuple() `: This function converts a sequence (list, string, etc.) to a tuple.

`set()` : This function converts a sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.) to a set.

``` py
# Convert a string to an integer
x = "10"
y = int(x)

# Convert a float to an integer
x = 3.14
y = int(x)

# Convert an integer to a string
x = 10
y = str(x)

# Convert a string to a float
x = "3.14"
y = float(x)

# Convert a value to a boolean
x = 10
y = bool(x)

# Convert a list to a set
x = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
y = set(x)
```

### User input 

We can take user input using the `input()` function. The `input()` function allows the user to enter data from the keyboard, which is then stored as a string.

```py
name = input("What is your name ")
print(" My name is" + name )
```
output: What is your name?

denis

My name is denis
