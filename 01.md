### Basic print statements

`` print('hello all') ``

The `print()` function in Python is used to display text or output on the screen. In the example above, the message 'hello all' is passed as an argument to the `print()` function, and it is displayed on the screen when the program is run.


Define two string variables

``a = 'Learn Python Basics``
``b = " welcome to the class"``

Concatenate the two strings and assign the result to a new variable

``c = a + ',' + b``

Concatenate the new variable with additional strings and spaces, and assign the result back to itself

``c = ' ' + c + ' are you excited!' ``

Create a new string using string formatting and assign it to a new variable

``d = '{} by step by step processs'.format(a) ``

Print various properties of the string variables:

``print(a)      ``                    # Learn Python Basics

``print(a[9])    ``                   # B

``print(a[6:])     ``                 # Python Basics

In Python, you can extract a portion of a string using the slicing operator `[]`. The operator takes two arguments: the starting index and the ending index of the portion you want to extract. In the example above, `a[6:]` extracts a portion of the string `a` starting from the 7th character (index 6) to the end of the string. This portion is then assigned to a new variable `b`, which is printed to the screen. The result is `Python Basics`, which is the portion of the original string `a `starting from the 7th character.

``print(len(b))      ``               # 17

``print(b[0:8])        ``             #  welcome

``print(a.lower())  ``                # learn python basics

``print(b.upper())    ``              #  WELCOME TO THE CLASS

``print(a.count('n'))   ``            # 2

``print(b.find('o'))      ``          # 4

The `find()` method in Python is used to search for a substring within a string. It takes one argument, which is the substring you want to search for. The method returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string, or `-1 `if the substring is not found.

In the example above, the `find()` method is used to search for the first occurrence of the letter 'o' in the string `a`. The method returns the index of the first occurrence, which is 4. This value is then printed to the screen using the `print() `function.

``print(a.replace('Python', 'Python language'))``   # Learn Python language Basics

``print(c) ``                         #  Learn Python Basics, welcome to the class are you excited!

``print(d)    ``                      # Learn Python Basics by step by step processs

### Integers and floats 

Integers and Floats
`w = 10`
`print(type(w)) `  # Output: <class 'int'>

# Arithmetic operations
`print(10 + 2) `    # Output: 12
`print(3 - 20)  `   # Output: -17
`print(4 * 2)     ` # Output: 8
`print(33 / 4)   `  # Output: 8.25
`print(44 % 2)  `   # Output: 0
`print(3 // 5) `    # Output: 0
`print(3 ** 2)`     # Output: 9

`print(99 * 9 + 1)` # Output: 892

# Using variables 
`w += 22`
`print(w) `         # Output: 32

`print(abs(-22))   `# Output: 22
`print(round(55.88)) `   # Output: 56
`print(round(99.333,2)) `# Output: 99.33

# Comparisons
`a = 20`
`b = 60`

`print(a == b)   `  # Output: False
`print(a != b)    ` # Output: True
`print(a > b)      `# Output: False
`print(a < b)    `  # Output: True
`print(a >= b)    ` # Output: False
`print(a <= b)     `# Output: True

# Strings
`a = '292' `
`b = '44' `

`print(a + b)  `    # Output: '29244'
