### Lists in Python

Lists in Python are a collection of items. They can be of any type and are written with square brackets `[]` with commas separating the items.

*Creating a list:*

To create a list, we can simply write comma-separated values inside the square brackets:
```py
names = ['joy','reni','reshma','bindhu']
```
*Accessing list items*

To access the list items, we can use indexing. The index starts from 0:
```py
print(names[2]) # outputs: reshma
```
We can also access a range of items in the list using the slicing operator `:`.
```py
print(names[:3]) # outputs: ['joy', 'reni', 'reshma']
print(names[2:]) # outputs: ['reshma', 'bindhu']
```
Modifying list
We can add items to the list using` append()` method.
```py
names.append("jeena")
```
We can insert items at a specific position using `insert()` method:
```py
names.insert(0,"ben")
```
We can also concatenate two lists using the + operator or using the `extend()` method:
```py
names.extend(fruits)
```
We can remove an item from the list using the `remove()` method:
```py
names.remove("reni")
```
We can remove the last item from the list using the `pop()` method. We can also remove an item at a specific position using the `pop()` method:
```py
names.pop()
names.pop()
names.pop()
```
We can reverse the order of items in the list using the `reverse()` method.
We can sort the items in the list using the `sort()` method. We can also sort in reverse order using the `sort(reverse = True)` method.
If we don't want to alter the original list and make a copy of sorted list, we can use the `sorted()` function instead of the `sort()` method.
```py
names.reverse()
fruits.sort()
nums.sort()
nums.sort(reverse = True)
new_list = sorted(nums)
```

We can find the minimum and maximum values of the list using the `min()` and `max()` methods.
We can also find the sum of all the values in the list using the `sum()` method.
We can find the index of an item in the list using the `index()` method.
```py
print(min(nums))
print(max(nums))
print(sum(nums))
print(names.index('joy'))
```
We can check if an item is present in the list using the `in` operator:
```py
print('old' in names)
print('bindhu' in names)
```
We can iterate through all the items in the list using a `for` loop.We can also iterate through all the items in the list along with their index using the `enumerate()` function.
```py
for all_names in names:
    print(all_names)

for index,all_names in enumerate(names):
    print(index,all_names)
```
We can join the list items into a single string using the `join()` method. We can split a string into a list using the `split()` method:
```py
new = '---'.join(fruits)
back = new.split('---')
```
