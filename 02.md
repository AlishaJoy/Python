### if else elif

``` py 
# if else elif

a = 'joy'

if a == 'joyful':
    print('it is equal joyful')
elif a == 'joy':
    print("it is equal to joy")  
elif a == 'welcome':
    print("it is equal to welcome") 
else:
    print("not equal")
    
    
b = 'happy'
c = 'new year'

if a == 'happy' and c =='new year':
    print('happy new year!!')
elif a == 'happy' or c == 'new year': 
    print("happy new year!")
elif not c:
    print('oo')
else:
    print("not matched")               

      
r = [10,20,30]
t = [10,20,30] 

print(id(r))
print(id(t))

# 'is' operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory
print(r is t)

# '==' operator checks if two variables have the same value
print(r == t)     

# 'id' function returns the identity (unique integer) of an object
print(id(r) != id(t))


# checking true conditions
 
pop = 0

if pop:
    print("it is true")
else:
    print("it is false")
        
# other false conditions are:
# False, None, empty sequence '', (), {}, []

op = 'hello'

if op:
    print("true")
else:
    print("false")    
    
# other true conditions:
# numerical values
```
In this code, you have demonstrated the use of if-else and elif statements to execute different blocks of code based on different conditions.

In the first block, you compare the value of the variable `a` with different values using the `==` operator. If the condition is true, the corresponding block of code is executed. If none of the conditions are true, the `else` bl- User input

- Prebuild functionsock is executed.

In the second block, you demonstrate the use of logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to combine multiple conditions.

You then create two lists `r` and `t`, and check their identities using the `is` operator. Since they have the same values but refer to different objects in memory, the `is` operator returns `False`. You then check if they have the same values using the `==` operator, which returns `True`.

You also demonstrate how to check if a variable is considered true or false by Python. In Python, any value that is not zero or `None` is considered true. You can use this feature to check if a variable has a value or not.

Finally, you mention that other true conditions include numerical values, since any non-zero numerical value is considered true.

### for

Loops in Python are used for repetitive tasks that need to be executed multiple times. There are two types of loops in Python: `for` loop and `while` loop.

A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, dictionary, etc.) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. Here's an example:

```py
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)
```

Output:
`
10
20
30
40
50
`

In the above example, the `for` loop iterates over the `numbers` list and prints each item one by one.

We can use the `break` statement inside a loop to exit the loop prematurely. Here's an example:

```py
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

for num in numbers:
    if num == 30:
        break
    print(num)
```

Output:
`
10
20
`

In the above example, the `break` statement is used to exit the loop when the value of `num` becomes `30`.

We can also use the `continue` statement inside a loop to skip over certain items and continue with the next item. Here's an example:

```py
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

for num in numbers:
    if num == 30:
        continue
    print(num)
```

Output:
```
10
20
40
50
```

In the above example, the `continue` statement is used to skip over the item with a value of `30`.
### while

A `while` loop is used to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met. Here's an example:

```
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

In the above example, the `while` loop continues to execute the block of code until the value of `count` becomes `5`.

We can use the `break` statement inside a `while` loop to exit the loop prematurely. Here's an example:

```
count = 0

while True:
    if count == 5:
        break
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

In the above example, the `break` statement is used to exit the loop when the value of `count` becomes `5`.

In conclusion, `for` loops are used to iterate over a sequence and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence, while `while` loops are used to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met. The `break` and `continue` statements can be used inside loops to exit the loop prematurely or skip over certain items.
